# VBA-challenge
In this challenge, I completed the VBA scripting for analyzing opening/closing prices, total volume, and their respective tickers for stocks across 4 quarters.

I leveraged the class assignments, TA support, and AskBCS on the assignment. I leveraged TA support and AskBCS specifically on calculating Greatest % Increase/Decrease and Greatest Total Volume. I also received guidance on the LastTicker calculations and the Match function.

I used Google to look up how to format perentages.
